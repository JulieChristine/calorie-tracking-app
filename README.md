# ${1:calorie-tracking-app}
A food tracking application. Users are able to log foods theyâ€™ve eaten during the day, including details about the meal and its number of calories.
## Installation
Through the command line install Node (npm install) and Bower (bower install). 

## Usage
This application makes it possible to:
Log a food you have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
View a list of foods you have logged.
View all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
Edit a food you have submitted - its name, details or calories (in case you decide to pretend your fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
